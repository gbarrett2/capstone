**Sean Andrew Chen**\
As an urban planner and policy researcher, Sean Andrew Chen is interested in using the latest quantitative and analytical techniques to understand the underlying geospatial patterns of cities as well as applying the latest science to create more livable cities.
Chen has worked extensively in the federal government, performing research in the White House, US Department of Housing and Urban Development, and US Army Corps of Engineers. In addition, he has spent time as a researcher at the University of Washington.
Chen has an AB and MPA from the Princeton University School of Public and International Affairs. He has also studied at The Juilliard School, University College London Bartlett School of Planning, and National Taiwan University. Currently, Chen attends the New York University Center for Urban Science and Progress. He will attend Rutgers University Bloustein School of Planning and Policy for a doctoral degree in urban planning this coming fall.\

**Professor Debra Laefer**\
With degrees from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (MS, Ph.D.), NYU (MEng), and Columbia University (BS, BA), Prof. Debra Laefer has a wide-ranging background spanning from geotechnical and structural engineering to art history and historic preservation. Not surprisingly, Prof. Laeferâ€™s work often stands at the cross-roads of technology creation and community values such as devising technical solutions for protecting architecturally significant buildings from sub-surface construction. As the density of her aerial remote sensing datasets continues to grow exponentially with time, Prof. Laefer and her Urban Modeling Group must help pioneer computationally efficient storage, querying, and visualization strategies that both harness distributed computing-based solutions and bridge the gap between data availability and its usability for the engineering community.
